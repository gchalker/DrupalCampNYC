Git training from the 2015 Drupal Camp NYC

Hello, sitting here at the U.N. after taking the Peter Bell github training session. This respository will be my first change to a Github repository.  I do hope that I am on my way to learning Github and all its advantageous.  I am interested in learning how Git interacts with Cloud Hosting environments.

See you tomorrow, Git repository.

G.
